    <h1>Heya!</h1>
    <p>Hey! Thanks for visiting my page! My name is Jeff and I'm a software developer with a passion for all things tech! Since I was a kid, I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a computer and was instantly hooked on the possibilities. I was constantly fascinated by the constantly evolving user interface and experience on the web, so I chose to study in UI/UX design in college. During my time there I've gotten in touch with the world of programming, and have loved it since then. Sitting and typing aside I enjoy a large array of things that I cannot possibly handle in my lifetime. But right now I enjoy rock climbing to challenge myself to overcome my fear of heights and I really like the problem solving aspect of it! </p>

    <p>Now that you know a little bit about me, let's try a fun quiz!</p>
